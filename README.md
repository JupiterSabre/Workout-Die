# WORKOUT DIE

Make a randomiser button that recommends workouts for a HIIT session.
The button should recommend a set, if it is timed, a timer is triggered, and button becomes clickable again.
The rendered workout includes the name, gif/img, workout focus, and timer clock countdown if applicable.
***Bonus -- when a workout is completed, it is appended so the circuit chronology is recorded (populate a form/div with unordered list)

### Making Updates

Since Render deployment integrates with your GitHub repo, you can easily deploy
changes to your database. First, commit and push your code up to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updated database"
git push
```

Then launch the build process by going to the page for your server on the
Render dashboard, clicking the "Manual Deploy" button in the upper right corner
of the page, and selecting "Deploy latest commit."
