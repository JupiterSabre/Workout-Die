#PHASE 1 PROJECT -- HIIT DIE

Existing is hard. Being a domesticated mammalian animal during late stage capitalism is hard. And yet, our meat sack won't take care of themselves! Fear not, we've put together a High Intensity Interval Training tool to help you get those reps in in the privacy of your cubicle, on the subway, or mid-lecture while you try and parse out what the hell a react component is.

Save your workout circuit, keep your favorites, show off to your friends.




# WORKOUT DIE

Make a randomiser button that recommends workouts for a HIIT session.
The button should recommend a set, if it is timed, a timer is triggered, and button becomes clickable again.
The rendered workout includes the name, gif/img, workout focus, and timer clock countdown if applicable.
***Bonus -- when a workout is completed, it is appended so the circuit chronology is recorded (populate a form/div with unordered list)

### Making Updates

Since Render deployment integrates with your GitHub repo, you can easily deploy
changes to your database. First, commit and push your code up to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updated database"
git push
```

Then launch the build process by going to the page for your server on the
Render dashboard, clicking the "Manual Deploy" button in the upper right corner
of the page, and selecting "Deploy latest commit."
