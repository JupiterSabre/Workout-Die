# WORKOUT DIE (phase 1 project: Zulai R & Ronil Patel) 


Existing is hard. Being a domesticated mammalian animal during late stage capitalism is hard. And yet, our meat sack won't take care of itself! Fear not, we've put together a High Intensity Interval Training tool to help you get those reps in in the privacy of your cubicle, on the subway, or mid-lecture while you try and parse out what the hell a react component is.

Save your workout circuit, keep your favorites, show off to your friends, stay hydrated.

####How to use:
1. Click on the die to generate a random workout rep. You can generate reps and make your circuit as long as you want.
2. Clear the circuit by clicing the clear circuit button.
3. Archive a circuit by clicking archive.
4. Remove an archived card by double clicking the remove button.
5. Email your circuit by clicking email. This will open your mail client with the circuit listed. Make sure to replace placeholder email to who you are sending.
